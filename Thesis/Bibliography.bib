	abstract = {The choice of activation functions in deep networks has a significant effect on the training dynamics and task performance. Currently, the most successful and widely-used activation function is the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU). Although various hand-designed alternatives to ReLU have been proposed, none have managed to replace it due to inconsistent gains. In this work, we propose to leverage automatic search techniques to discover new activation functions. Using a combination of exhaustive and reinforcement learning-based search, we discover multiple novel activation functions. We verify the effectiveness of the searches by conducting an empirical evaluation with the best discovered activation function. Our experiments show that the best discovered activation function, \$f(x) = x {\textbackslash}cdot {\textbackslash}text\{sigmoid\}({\textbackslash}beta x)\$, which we name Swish, tends to work better than ReLU on deeper models across a number of challenging datasets. For example, simply replacing ReLUs with Swish units improves top-1 classification accuracy on ImageNet by 0.9{\textbackslash}\% for Mobile NASNet-A and 0.6{\textbackslash}\% for Inception-ResNet-v2. The simplicity of Swish and its similarity to ReLU make it easy for practitioners to replace ReLUs with Swish units in any neural network.},

Though the book is not intended as a general course in neural networks, no background in neural works is assumed and all models are presented from the ground up.The principle focus of the book is the three layer feedforward network, for more than a decade as the workhorse of professional arsenals. Other network models with strong performance records are also included.Bound in the book is an IBM diskette that includes the source code for all programs in the book.

By contrast, the lasso is not a very satisfactory variable selection method in the p n case. An algorithm called LARS-EN is proposed for computing elastic net regularization paths efficiently, much like algorithm LARS does for the lasso.},

For a given set of potential predictor variables we combine forecasts from all possible linear regression models that keep the number of predictors fixed. We explore how the choice of model complexity, as measured by the number of included predictor variables, can be used to trade off the bias and variance of the forecast errors, generating a setup akin to the efficient frontier known from modern portfolio theory. In an application to predictability of stock returns, we find that combinations of subset regressions can produce more accurate forecasts than conventional approaches based on equal-weighted forecasts (which fail to account for the dimensionality of the underlying models), combinations of univariate forecasts, or forecasts generated by methods such as bagging, ridge regression or Bayesian Model Averaging.},

Viewed in this way, asset pricing studies can be revisited using multi-layer deep learners, such as rectified linear units (ReLU) or long-short-term-memory (LSTM) for time-series effects. State-of-the-art algorithms including stochastic gradient descent (SGD), TensorFlow and dropout design provide imple- mentation and efficient factor exploration. To illustrate our methodology, we revisit the equity market risk premium dataset of Welch and Goyal (2008). We find the existence of nonlinear factors which explain predictability of returns, in particular at the extremes of the characteristic space. Finally, we conclude with directions for future research.},

	abstract = {This study seeks to inform investment academics and practitioners by describing and analyzing the population of return predictive signals (RPS) publicly identiﬁed over the 40-year period 1970–2010. Our supraview brings to light new facts about RPS, including that more than 330 signals have been reported; the properties of newly discovered RPS are stable over time; and RPS with higher mean returns have larger standard deviations of returns and also higher Sharpe ratios. Using a sample of 39 readily programmed RPS, we estimate that the average crosscorrelation of RPS returns is close to zero and that the average correlation between RPS returns and the market is reliably negative. Abstracting from implementation costs, this implies that portfolios of RPS either on their own or in combination with the market will tend to have quite high Sharpe ratios. For academics who seek to document that they have found a genuinely new RPS, we show that the probability that a randomly chosen RPS has a positive alpha after being orthogonalized against ﬁve (25) other randomly chosen RPS is 62 \% (32 \%), suggesting that the returns of a potentially new RPS need to be orthogonalized against the returns of some but not all pre-existing RPS. Finally, we posit that our ﬁndings pose a challenge to investment academics in that they imply that either US stock markets are pervasively inefﬁcient, or there exist a much larger number of rationally priced sources of risk in equity returns than previously thought.},

	abstract = {Despite their massive size, successful deep artificial neural networks can exhibit a remarkably small difference between training and test performance. Conventional wisdom attributes small generalization error either to properties of the model family, or to the regularization techniques used during training. Through extensive systematic experiments, we show how these traditional approaches fail to explain why large neural networks generalize well in practice. Specifically, our experiments establish that state-of-the-art convolutional networks for image classification trained with stochastic gradient methods easily fit a random labeling of the training data. This phenomenon is qualitatively unaffected by explicit regularization, and occurs even if we replace the true images by completely unstructured random noise. We corroborate these experimental findings with a theoretical construction showing that simple depth two neural networks already have perfect finite sample expressivity as soon as the number of parameters exceeds the number of data points as it usually does in practice. We interpret our experimental findings by comparison with traditional models.},

These assumptions enable us to explain the complexity of the fully decoupled neural network through the prism of the results from random matrix theory. We show that for large-size decoupled networks the lowest critical values of the random loss function form a layered structure and they are located in a well-defined band lower-bounded by the global minimum. The number of local minima outside that band diminishes exponentially with the size of the network. We empirically verify that the mathematical model exhibits similar behavior as the computer simulations, despite the presence of high dependencies in real networks. We conjecture that both simulated annealing and SGD converge to the band of low critical points, and that all critical points found there are local minima of high quality measured by the test error. This emphasizes a major difference between large- and small-size networks where for the latter poor quality local minima have non-zero probability of being recovered. Finally, we prove that recovering the global minimum becomes harder as the network size increases and that it is in practice irrelevant as global minimum often leads to overfitting.},

We also demonstrate that for appropriately tuned explicit regularization (e.g., dropout) we can degrade DNN training performance on noise datasets without compromising generalization on real data. Our analysis suggests that the notions of effective capacity which are dataset independent are unlikely to explain the generalization performance of deep networks when trained with gradient based methods because training data itself plays an important role in determining the degree of memorization.},

	abstract = {Data subject to heavy-tailed errors are commonly encountered in various scientiﬁc ﬁelds. To address this problem, procedures based on quantile regression and least absolute deviation regression have been developed in recent years. These methods essentially estimate the conditional median (or quantile) function. They can be very different from the conditional mean functions, especially when distributions are asymmetric and heteroscedastic. How can we efﬁciently estimate the mean regression functions in ultrahigh dimensional settings with existence of only the second moment? To solve this problem, we propose a penalized Huber loss with diverging parameter to reduce biases created by the traditional Huber loss. Such a penalized robust approximate (RA) quadratic loss will be called the RA lasso. In the ultrahigh dimensional setting, where the dimensionality can grow exponentially with the sample size, our results reveal that the RA lasso estimator produces a consistent estimator at the same rate as the optimal rate under the light tail situation. We further study the computational convergence of the RA lasso and show that the composite gradient descent algorithm indeed produces a solution that admits the same optimal rate after sufﬁcient iterations. As a by-product, we also establish the concentration inequality for estimating the population mean when there is only the second moment. We compare the RA lasso with other regularized robust estimators based on quantile regression and least absolute deviation regression. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate the satisfactory ﬁnite sample performance of the RA lasso.},

In regressions where the lagged instruments interact with a market index return, the spurious regression problem is not as severe. Without persistent time-variation in the expected market return and beta, spurious regression bias is not an important issue.

Why should the consumption–wealth ratio forecast asset returns? We show that a wide class of optimal models of consumer behavior imply that the log consumption–aggregate wealth (human capital plus asset holdings) ratio summarizes expected returns on aggregate wealth, or the market portfolio. Although this ratio is not observable, we provide assumptions under which its important predictive components for future asset returns may be expressed in terms of observable variables, namely in terms of consumption, asset holdings and labor income. The framework implies that these variables are cointegrated, and that deviations from this shared trend summarize agents' expectations of future returns on the market portfolio.},

We also investigate the performance of six variations of the original random forest method, all aimed at improving robustness. These variations are based on three main ideas: (1) robustify the aggregation method, (2) robustify the splitting criterion and (3) taking a robust transformation of the response. More precisely, with the first idea, we use the median (or weighted median), instead of the mean, to combine the predictions from the individual trees. With the second idea, we use least-absolute deviations from the median, instead of least-squares, as splitting criterion. With the third idea, we build the trees using the ranks of the response instead of the original values. The competing methods are compared via a simulation study with artificial data using two different types of contaminations and also with 13 real data sets. Our results show that all three ideas improve the robustness of the original random forest algorithm. However, a robust aggregation of the individual trees is generally more profitable than a robust splitting criterion.},

We apply our procedure to a set of factors recently discovered in the literature. While most of these new factors are found to be redundant relative to the existing factors, a few — such as proﬁtability — have statistically signiﬁcant explanatory power beyond the hundreds of factors proposed in the past. In addition, we show that our estimates and their signiﬁcance are stable, whereas the model selected by simple LASSO is not. Finally, we provide additional applications of our procedure that illustrate how it could help control the proliferation of factors in the zoo.},

We propose a three-pass method to estimate the risk premium of an observable factor, which is valid even when not all factors in the model are speciﬁed or observed. We show that the risk premium of the observable factor can be identiﬁed regardless of the rotation of the other control factors, as long as they together span the true factor space. Motivated by this rotation invariance result, our approach uses principal components of test asset returns to recover the factor space and additional cross-sectional and time-series regressions to obtain the risk premium of the observed factor. Our estimator is also equivalent to the average excess return of a mimicking portfolio maximally correlated with the observed factor using appropriate regularization. Our methodology also accounts for potential measurement error in the observed factor and detects when such a factor is spurious or even useless. The methodology exploits the blessings of dimensionality, and we therefore use a large panel of equity portfolios to estimate risk premia for several workhorse factors. The estimates are robust to the choice of test portfolios within equities as well as across many asset classes.},

We examine the pricing implications of a consistent deviation of earnings from cash flow. Measuring the consistent deviation by accrual volatility, we find a strong and long-lasting negative association between accrual volatility and future stock returns. In decile portfolios that rank accrual volatility, a hedge portfolio that goes long in the lowest decile and short in the highest decile generates an annual, risk-adjusted return in the order of 10\% from one-month to five-year horizon. These results are robust to common risk factors and return-informative variables, extend to both operating accruals and discretionary accruals, are distinct from the accrual anomaly, and are not subsumed by transaction costs and short-sale constraints. In addition, an accrual-volatility mimicking portfolio provides additional explanatory power to returns on the Fama-French 25 size/book to market portfolio. The accrual volatility effect is consistent with the information uncertainty effect where higher historical information uncertainty leads to lower future returns, and is also consistent with the earnings fixation hypothesis in that investors overprice the transitory accruals component of earnings in high accrual volatility stocks.},
