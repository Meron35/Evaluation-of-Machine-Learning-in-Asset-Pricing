# Evaluation-of-Machine-Learning-in-Asset-Pricing

GitHub Repository for my honours thesis at Monash University

Topic: Evaluation of Machine Learning in Asset Pricing

Supervisor: David Frazier

All code is in the R folder, and all files related to the actual thesis are in the Thesis folder.

Simulation code should be finished, in "Simulation.rmd". This includes flexible options to specify different parameters and properties. Generation of each panel dataset in a panel dataframe format, along with diagnostics such as various r squared values are all possible with provided functions. This section is to be run to generate the actual datasets first.

Simulation model fitting code is in "Simulation Models.rmd". This requires the supply of datasets from the simulation code.

R folder contains files from Rob Hyndman's bookdown thesis skeleton. Don't think I'll be using bookdown, but I've left it there just in case.

Currently writing proposal in the actual thesis tex file because it just happens to have everything in one place already, and most fo the introduction/literature review will be reused anyway. Planning to just copy and paste the elements that I need from the thesis tex file into the separate proposal tex file.

Folder structure of the repo might change once regression results and plots are start coming in from the coding section for easier embedation into the thesis.
