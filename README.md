# Evaluation-of-Machine-Learning-in-Asset-Pricing

GitHub Repository for my honours thesis at Monash University

Topic: Evaluation of Machine Learning in Asset Pricing

Supervisor: David Frazier

All code is in the R folder, and all files related to the actual thesis are in the Thesis folder.

All coding work so far has been done on simulation, contained in "Simulation.rmd"

R folder contains files from Rob Hyndman's bookdown thesis skeleton. Don't think I'll be using bookdown, but I've left it there just in case.

Currently writing proposal in the actual thesis tex file because it just happens to have everything in one place already, and most fo the introduction/literature review will be reused anyway. Planning to just copy and paste the elements that I need from the thesis tex file into the separate proposal tex file.

Presentation slides are wholly separate.

Folder structure of the repo might change once regression results and plots are start coming in from the coding section for easier embedation into the thesis.
